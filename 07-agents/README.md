# Agent Subsystems & Multi-Agent Orchestration

Autonomous agent capabilities including swarm orchestration, coordinator system, daemon agents, session teleport, and remote bridge protocol. This section covers leader-follower team coordination, file-based IPC, permission brokering, and distributed agent communication.

Swarm orchestration: leader-follower team structure with file-based mailbox IPC and three execution backends (tmux, iTerm2, in-process).

Agent loop execution: initialization → mailbox polling → permission checking → task execution → status update.

## Key Findings

### Swarm Orchestration

- **Leader-Follower Architecture**: Single leader coordinates multiple workers with distributed decision-making
- **Three Execution Backends**:
  - `TmuxBackend` — Terminal multiplexer integration for pane management
  - `ITermBackend` — Native iTerm2 split-pane API integration
  - `InProcessBackend` — Same-process execution with isolated context
- **File-Based Mailbox IPC**: Message passing via `~/.claude/teams/{team-name}/mailbox/{agent-name}/`
  - `messages.json` for message storage
  - Atomic updates with lockfile synchronization
  - 1000ms polling interval for inbox checks
- **Permission Brokering**: Only team-lead approved as request sender; delegation maintains audit trail
- **Teammate Spawn Lifecycle**: Registration → environment setup → agent loop initialization → team context injection
- **Layout Management**: Color assignment and pane delegation for visual team identification

### Coordinator System

- **Coordinator Mode**: Leadership delegation for policy-driven team decisions
- **Voice Pipeline**: Audio/voice integration for agent communication
- **Moreright System**: Policy enforcement and decision validation for safety-critical operations
- **Team Memory Sharing**: Context propagation across swarm agents

### Session Teleport

- **Cross-Environment Movement**: Transfer execution context between local and remote environments
- **State Preservation**: Maintain session state, memory, and task context during transition
- **Seamless Switching**: Transparent switchover without task interruption

### Daemon & Proactive Agents

- **Background Execution**: Persistent agents running independently of main session
- **Event-Driven Model**: React to file changes, timers, and external signals
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Autonomous checks and pre-emptive actions

### Remote Bridge Protocol

- **Distributed Coordination**: Network-transparent agent communication
- **Message Routing**: Reliable delivery across network boundaries
- **Security Isolation**: Sandboxed execution with capability-based access control
