# Tools, Commands & Plugin System

Complete analysis of Claude Code's tool execution, command dispatch, plugin lifecycle, skill system, and extension points. This section covers the ~150 built-in commands, dynamic plugin system with 20,521 LOC across 44 files, MCP integration, computer-use capabilities, and the Claude-in-Chrome extension.

## Architecture Diagrams

Command dispatch flow: command lookup → feature-flag evaluation → auth-gating → execution model selection (prompt/local/local-jsx).

Plugin lifecycle: discovery → validation → installation → hook registration → execution → update checks → delisting.

Streaming tool executor architecture for managing concurrent tool invocations with resource limits and cancellation.

## Key Findings

### Command System

- **~150 Built-in Commands**: 189 command files with 26,428 LOC covering operations, debugging, workflows, and analysis
- **3 Execution Types**:
  - `prompt` — Commands rendered as text and invoked by the model
  - `local` — JavaScript/TypeScript executed locally in Node.js
  - `local-jsx` — Terminal UI components rendered via Ink
- **Memoized Registry**: `COMMANDS()` function caches results to avoid repeated environment reads and config file I/O
- **Feature-Flagged Loading**: Conditional imports using Bun's `feature()` API defer expensive commands until bundling
- **Auth-Gated Commands**: `INTERNAL_ONLY_COMMANDS` array filters Anthropic-only commands from external builds via `USER_TYPE` check
- **Lazy-Loaded 3,200-Line Commands**: `/insights` command defers import to avoid bloating initial bundle

### Plugin System

- **20,521 LOC across 44 Files**: Comprehensive plugin infrastructure managing discovery, validation, installation, execution, and updates
- **Plugin Lifecycle**: `discovery` → `validation` → `install` → `execute` → `update` → `delist`
- **Three Discovery Sources**:
  - Marketplace plugins (versioned ZIP cache)
  - Inline plugins (`--plugin-dir` CLI flag)
  - Built-in plugins (hardcoded, no external dependencies)
- **Five-Scope Priority Merging**: `managed` > `user` > `project` > `local` > `flag` for per-repo configuration control
- **Component Detection**: Plugins support commands, agents, skills, output styles, hooks, and MCP servers
- **Dependency Resolution**: DFS algorithm with cycle detection; cross-marketplace boundary enforcement
- **Security Measures**:
  - Homograph attack detection in plugin names
  - Path traversal prevention
  - Manifest validation (Zod schema)
  - ZIP integrity verification

### Tool Contracts

- **Streaming Tool Executor**: Manages concurrent tool invocations with resource pooling and cancellation support
- **Computer Use**: Screen capture, mouse/keyboard input, action sequencing with feedback
- **Chrome Extension**: Tab management, DOM manipulation, JavaScript execution in isolated context
- **MCP Integration**: Protocol support for distributed tool providers

### Bundled Skills

- Built-in skill catalog with operators, analyzers, and workflow automation
- Output-style extensibility for custom rendering
- Hook system for plugin lifecycle integration
