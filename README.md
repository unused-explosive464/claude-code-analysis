## The Stuff They Don't Tell You

Claude Code isn't just a chat-in-terminal wrapper. It's a 1,902-file TypeScript monolith with its own React rendering engine, a multi-agent swarm system, a two-stage AI safety classifier, and 88 hidden feature flags — many for features that don't exist yet.

Here are some of the things we found buried in the source:

**There's a hidden AI that judges every command you run.** Before Claude Code executes a tool call, a separate classifier called "YOLO" runs a two-stage evaluation. Stage 1 is a fast 64-token scan. If it's suspicious, Stage 2 does a full 4,096-token reasoning pass to decide: allow, deny, or ask the user. Temperature is zero. It errs on the side of blocking. → [Full breakdown](05-security/README.md)

**Your conversations get secretly compressed.** When context pressure exceeds 93%, Claude Code runs one of six compaction strategies — from lightweight microcompaction (clearing old tool results) to spawning an entire forked subprocess that summarizes your conversation into a 9-section format. You never see this happen. → [How compaction works](04-systems/README.md)

**It ships an entire React rendering engine for the terminal.** Not a simple TUI library. A custom React Fiber reconciler, a Yoga flex-layout engine, a screen buffer with packed Int32Arrays, and a frame-diffing system that reduces terminal output from 10KB to 50 bytes on idle scroll. 7,743 lines of rendering code. → [Ink pipeline deep dive](01-architecture/README.md)

**Multi-agent "swarms" communicate through files on disk.** When Claude Code spawns parallel agents, they coordinate via a file-based mailbox system at `~/.claude/work/ipc/` with 500ms polling. The leader writes JSON task messages, followers pick them up. There's a documented race condition where a malicious task could hijack the permission bridge. → [Swarm architecture](07-agents/README.md)

**88+ feature flags control unreleased capabilities.** Build-time flags like `experimental_agents`, `enable_voice_input`, `unsafe_bash_allowed`, and `plugin_marketplace` reveal features in development. 600+ runtime flags prefixed `tengu_` are evaluated through GrowthBook. Dead code elimination strips inactive paths at build time. → [Feature flag matrix](08-history/README.md)

**The system prompt is 30-40K tokens of hidden instructions.** Split into 7 static sections (cached globally) and 13 dynamic sections (rebuilt per session), with a deliberate cache-busting boundary after MCP instructions that forces a new cache block. → [Prompt ordering map](03-prompts/README.md)

## What This Repository Is

82 analysis documents. 112,000+ lines of research. 15 architectural diagrams. Every major subsystem mapped, from the bootstrap sequence to the permission engine.

This isn't a shallow overview — it's a complete architectural reconstruction of how a production AI agent actually works under the hood.

## Use It As a Skill (Plug & Play)

This repo isn't just for reading. **Install the `/internals` skill** and your Claude Code agent autonomously consults its own architectural map while working on your tasks.

```bash
# One command — installs globally across all projects
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/internals && curl -sL \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thtskaran/claude-code-analysis/master/.claude/skills/internals/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/internals/SKILL.md
```

**What happens:** Claude Code gets a skill that auto-triggers when it detects situations where self-knowledge would help — context growing long, tools getting blocked, agents needing coordination, prompts needing optimization. It fetches the relevant document from this repo via WebFetch and applies the architectural knowledge in real-time.

You can also invoke it manually: `/internals compaction`, `/internals permissions`, `/internals agents`, etc.

## How the Source Became Available

On March 31, 2026, security researcher [Chaofan Shou](https://x.com/AntiFried_rice) noticed that Claude Code's npm package contained a `.map` file referencing unobfuscated TypeScript sources on Anthropic's R2 storage bucket — making the full `src/` tree publicly downloadable. Not a breach or hack. A packaging oversight.

This repository is a research archive of that snapshot. The original source remains Anthropic's property. We are not affiliated with Anthropic.
