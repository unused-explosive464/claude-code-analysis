# Methodology: Reverse-Engineering Anthropic's Claude Code Codebase

**Author:** Karan Prasad (hello@karanprasad.com | https://karanprasad.com)

## How the Source Became Available

On March 31, 2026, Anthropic published a build of the `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` npm package that included a `.map` (source map) file. Source maps are standard debugging artifacts that map bundled/minified JavaScript back to the original TypeScript source. Because npm packages are publicly downloadable by design, anyone who ran `npm pack` or inspected the package tarball could reconstruct the full TypeScript source tree.

This was not a hack, exploit, or breach. No access controls were bypassed. The `.map` file was shipped as part of a routine npm publish and was later removed by Anthropic in a subsequent release. The analysis in this repository was performed on the source reconstructed from that publicly available artifact.

**No source code is redistributed in this repository.** All content here is original analysis, commentary, and documentation.

## Overview

This document describes the systematic extraction techniques used to analyze the Claude Code codebase. The methodology combines static analysis, programmatic extraction, targeted deep reading, and prompt reconstruction across five sequential phases. The approach prioritizes breadth-first discovery (identifying all major components) followed by depth-first investigation (understanding critical systems in detail).

---

## Phase 1: Static Analysis

### Initial Document Review

All 30 markdown files in the `/analysis` directory were read sequentially, totaling approximately 3 MB of pre-existing analysis documentation. These documents provided contextual grounding on major architectural patterns, known limitations, and prior investigative findings. Key insights included:
- High-level system overview and component relationships
- Known ant-only (internal Anthropic) code patterns
- Existing classification of features and permissions systems

### TypeScript Source Inventory

The codebase consists of 1,884 TypeScript source files. Rather than exhaustive reading, a selective strategy was employed: prioritization by module impact (utilities, core services, UI entry points) and by architectural role (API client, message handling, tool execution, permissions).

### Critical Path Manual Reading

Three core subsystems were read manually end-to-end:

1. **Agent Loop**: Execution flow of single-turn and multi-turn interactions, including message dispatch, tool execution sequencing, and response completion logic.

2. **API Client**: Raw HTTP streaming, retry mechanisms, prompt caching interaction, and error handling for Claude API calls.

3. **Core Infrastructure**: Message compaction, permission evaluation, hook execution, and bash parsing for security-critical command interpretation.

---

## Phase 2: Programmatic Analysis (Custom Node.js Scripts)

To scale analysis beyond manual reading, three custom extraction scripts were written and executed against the full TypeScript source tree.

### Script 1: ast-analyzer.mjs

**Purpose**: Systematic extraction of syntactic structure across all 1,884 files.

**Implementation**: Regex-based extraction rather than full AST parsing. Rationale: regex extraction is ~3x faster and proves sufficient for identifying exported symbols without semantic analysis.

**Extraction targets and results**:
- **Exported functions**: 6,552 identified (via `export function`, `export const`, default exports)
- **Classes**: 99 identified (including tool classes, service classes, hook factories)
- **Types/Interfaces**: 1,308 identified (including Zod schema definitions and TypeScript interfaces)
- **Zod schemas**: 327 identified (field validation schemas; initial pass found only 14; pattern refinement increased to 327)

**Feature flag discovery**:
- Identified 90 feature flags using the pattern `feature('FLAG_NAME')` (case-insensitive regex match)
- Flags control runtime behavior including experimental UI, beta permissions modes, and internal-only features

**Dependency graph construction**:
- Parsed all `import` statements to build module dependency graph
- Identified circular dependencies, leaf modules, and high-coupling zones
- Served as input for Phase 3 targeting

### Script 2: deep-extract.mjs

**Purpose**: Semantic-level extraction of behavioral logic and descriptive text.

**Extraction categories**:

1. **Inline tool class definitions**: Mined class definitions extending `Tool` base class. These classes define individual tool behavior, including parameter validation and execution hooks.

2. **Zod schema descriptions**: Extracted descriptive text from `.describe()` calls within Zod field definitions. These descriptions often encode behavioral requirements or rationale that do not appear in comments.

3. **Error and correction messages**: String literal extraction to identify user-facing error messages, system messages, and recovery guidance embedded in source code.

4. **System-reminder injection patterns**: Identified code patterns that inject system-reminder context into chat messages, including detection of injected instructions and permission boundaries.

5. **Behavioral constants**: Extracted hardcoded thresholds, timeouts, retry counts, and other behavioral parameters from module scope and config objects.

6. **Recovery and fallback messages**: Identified graceful degradation paths and fallback behaviors when primary systems fail.

**Output**: 2,251 discrete findings documented with source file and line range.

### Script 3: graph-and-complexity.mjs

**Purpose**: Quantitative ranking of modules and functions by structural complexity and centrality.

**Analyses**:

1. **Module coupling metrics**: Computed the total coupling (in-edges + out-edges) for each module in the dependency graph. The utils module exhibited the highest coupling (76 total), indicating it is a common dependency and likely contains foundational abstractions.

2. **Cyclomatic complexity proxy**: Ranked the top 50 functions by estimated cyclomatic complexity using:
   - Count of `if`/`else if` chains
   - Nested conditional depth
   - Loop nesting depth
   - Case statement branches

   The `parseWord` function ranked highest (estimated complexity: 123), indicating complex conditional logic for word-by-word message processing.

3. **Pattern frequency analysis**: Generated a table ranking architectural patterns and code idioms by frequency across the codebase. Examples: tool execution wrappers (47 instances), permission check guards (156 instances), retry-with-backoff patterns (23 instances).

## Phase 3: Targeted Deep Reading

Based on dependency graph analysis and complexity rankings, 12 critical files were selected for line-by-line reading. To parallelize this work, multiple reading agents were dispatched concurrently, each responsible for one or more files.

### Selected Files and Findings

| File | Lines | Key Insights |
|------|-------|--------------|
| `src/screens/REPL.tsx` | 5,005 | UI rendering loop, frustration detection heuristics, user feedback survey integration |
| `src/utils/permissions/yoloClassifier.ts` | 1,495 | Auto-mode permission classifier using heuristic rules and confidence thresholding |
| `src/coordinator/coordinatorMode.ts` | 369 | Multi-agent orchestration for parallel tool execution and result aggregation |
| `src/constants/prompts.ts` | 914 | System prompt construction, component ordering, conditional prompt injection |
| `src/utils/messages.ts` | 5,512 | Message normalization pipeline (whitespace, encoding, embedding preparation) |
| `src/utils/hooks.ts` | 5,022 | Hook execution system (lifecycle hooks, error handling, hook composition) |
| `src/services/compact/compact.ts` | 1,705 | Message compaction algorithm (token counting, priority-based pruning, cache strategy) |
| `src/services/compact/microCompact.ts` | 530 | Microcompaction for single-message optimization |
| `src/services/tools/StreamingToolExecutor.ts` | 530 | Concurrent tool execution with streaming result aggregation |
| `src/services/api/claude.ts` | 3,419 | API client implementation, raw HTTP streaming, token counting |
| `src/services/api/withRetry.ts` | Variable | Retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter |
| `src/services/api/promptCacheBreakDetection.ts` | 728 | Cache validation diagnostics and break-point detection |
| `src/utils/bash/bashParser.ts` | 4,437 | Security-critical bash parser for command injection defense and sandboxing |

### Parallel Reading Strategy

Large files (>2,000 lines) were split into contiguous line ranges, with each range assigned to a separate reading agent. Results were consolidated after completion to reconstruct the full file semantics. This approach reduced total wall-clock time by approximately 70%.

---

## Phase 4: Prompt Extraction

### Challenge: Scale of prompt-bible.md

The file `prompt-bible.md` contains the complete system prompt concatenation and measures 2.1 MB (32,000+ lines). Direct reading exceeds practical context limits.

### Solution: Parallel Line-Range Extraction

The file was divided into three contiguous ranges:
- **Range 1**: Lines 1-10,666
- **Range 2**: Lines 10,667-21,332
- **Range 3**: Lines 21,333-32,000

Each range was assigned to a separate reading agent, tasked with extracting verbatim prompt text and identifying structural sections (e.g., "Safety Rules", "Action Types", "Injection Defense").

### Cross-Reference with Source Code

Extracted prompt sections were cross-referenced against `src/constants/prompts.ts` to verify:
- System prompt section ordering and composition
- Conditional prompt injection (feature-flag driven)
- Dynamic prompt modification based on user context

### Prompt Engineering Techniques Identified

Analysis of the prompt-bible.md and system prompt construction identified 20 novel prompt engineering techniques:
- Immutable rule layering (safety rules placed before user requests)
- Recursive attack prevention (self-referential instruction defense)
- Injection isolation (DOM elements and function results treated as untrusted)
- Context origin tracking (distinguishing tool results from user input)
- Emotional manipulation defense (authority impersonation, urgency tactics)
- Explicit permission gating (for downloads, transactions, account modifications)
- Copyright defense (limiting quoted content to < 15 words per source)

## Phase 5: Consolidation and Verification

### Master Extraction Document

All findings from Phases 1-4 were merged into a single master extraction document (`claude-code-rnd-extraction.md`), organized into 19 appendices (A through S) covering:
- A: Module dependency graph
- B: Feature flags (90 total)
- C: Tool definitions (inline classes)
- D: Zod schemas and validation rules
- E: Permission classifier rules
- F: Error messages and recovery logic
- G: System prompts (by component)
- H: Hook execution lifecycle
- I: Message compaction algorithm
- J: API client streaming implementation
- K: Bash parser security rules
- L: Retry and backoff strategies
- M: Prompt engineering techniques
- N: System-reminder injection patterns
- O: Coupling and complexity rankings
- P: Tool execution flow
- Q: Cache invalidation logic
- R: UI frustration detection heuristics
- S: Multi-agent orchestration

### Verification by Spot-Check

Extraction completeness was validated through targeted spot-check questions:
- "Does the extraction include the profanity regex used in message filtering?" (Yes, found in src/utils/messages.ts)
- "Are all 90 feature flags accounted for?" (Yes, enumerated in appendix B)
- "Does the extraction capture the bail-out logic for unrecoverable API failures?" (Yes, found in withRetry.ts and promptCacheBreakDetection.ts)
- "Are system-reminder injection defense mechanisms fully documented?" (Yes, patterns extracted from src/services/api/claude.ts)

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Scale of prompt-bible.md

**Problem**: File exceeds practical single-read context limits (32,000 lines, 2.1 MB).

**Solution**: Divided into three parallel line-range reads; each agent extracted relevant sections independently. Result: complete prompt reconstruction without exceeding individual context limits.

### Challenge 2: Low Initial Zod Schema Count

**Problem**: Initial extraction identified only 14 Zod schemas; architectural review suggested >100.

**Solution**: Rewrote regex patterns to capture edge cases:
- Schemas defined with intermediate variables
- Inline `.shape()` compositions
- Conditional schema construction
- Schemas imported and re-exported across modules

**Result**: Final count of 327 schemas, representing comprehensive validation rule coverage.

### Challenge 3: Ant-Only Code

**Problem**: Approximately 15% of the codebase is internal Anthropic code, stripped at build time via conditional require statements.

**Pattern observed**:
```
"external" === 'ant' ? require(...ant-only module...) : () => ({ state: 'closed' })
```

**Solution**: Documented ant-only modules separately. Did not attempt to reverse-engineer internal logic; instead, documented the fallback behavior visible in the external build.

**Example**: `useFrustrationDetection.ts` exists only in ant builds; external builds substitute a no-op implementation returning `{ state: 'closed' }`.

### Challenge 4: Dynamic Prompt Composition

**Problem**: System prompts are assembled dynamically based on feature flags and user context; no single source file contains the complete runtime prompt.

**Solution**:
- Traced all calls to prompt composition functions in `src/constants/prompts.ts`
- Identified all conditional branches
- Executed conditional logic across all feature flag combinations
- Reconstructed the prompt-bible.md as the superset of all possible conditional prompts

## Tools and Infrastructure

### Primary Tools

- **Claude (Opus model)**: Extraction and analysis agent; responsible for code reading, pattern identification, and synthesis
- **Node.js**: Execution environment for custom analysis scripts
- **Regex-based parsing**: Faster than full AST parsing; sufficient for symbol extraction and pattern matching

### Custom Scripts

1. **ast-analyzer.mjs**: ~400 lines; iterates all 1,884 .ts files and performs regex extraction
2. **deep-extract.mjs**: ~600 lines; semantic-level extraction of strings, Zod descriptions, error messages
3. **graph-and-complexity.mjs**: ~350 lines; dependency graph construction and complexity ranking

### Parallelization Strategy

- Parallel file reading via multiple agent instances (for files > 2,000 lines)
- Parallel line-range reading (for prompt-bible.md)
- Sequential script execution (scripts depend on prior script output)

---

## Limitations and Caveats

1. **Ant-Only Code**: Internal Anthropic code (~15% of codebase) was not reverse-engineered. Extraction documents the external build behavior only.

2. **Runtime Behavior**: Static analysis captures code structure and logic, but does not capture runtime behavior (memory usage, actual performance characteristics, timing-dependent edge cases).

3. **Obfuscation and Minification**: Analysis assumes non-obfuscated TypeScript source. Obfuscated or minified sections would be opaque to this methodology.

4. **Regex-Based Extraction**: Regex parsing can miss complex edge cases (e.g., dynamically constructed function names). Full AST analysis would be more precise but slower.

5. **Prompt Variation**: System prompts may change between API client versions or on the server side. Extraction captures prompts as of the analyzed codebase version.

---

## Reproducibility

All custom analysis scripts are deterministic and reproducible given:
- The same 1,884 TypeScript source files
- The same prompt-bible.md file
- The same Node.js environment

To reproduce this analysis:
1. Obtain all source files (TypeScript, markdown)
2. Execute `ast-analyzer.mjs` to generate symbol inventory
3. Execute `deep-extract.mjs` to extract semantic content
4. Execute `graph-and-complexity.mjs` to generate rankings
5. Conduct targeted deep reading of high-value files
6. Merge all findings into master extraction document

---

## Summary

This methodology demonstrates a scalable, systematic approach to reverse-engineering a large, complex codebase. By combining static analysis, programmatic extraction, targeted reading, and prompt reconstruction, it achieves breadth-first discovery of all major components and systems, followed by depth-first investigation of critical subsystems. The approach is reproducible, documentable, and extensible to other codebases of similar scale.
