# Security Analysis

Security hardening, threat modeling, and vulnerability analysis of Claude Code. This section covers the permission engine with its two-stage YOLO classifier, the hand-rolled bash parser with fail-closed design, OAuth lifecycle management, and comprehensive security audits across all subsystems.

Permission engine decision pipeline: 7-stage flow from tool request through deny/ask rules to final permission decision.

Two-stage YOLO classifier: Stage 1 (64-token fast-pass on explicit denials) routes to Stage 2 (4,096-token reasoning) for full context analysis.

## Key Findings

### Permission System

- **6 Permission Modes**: `default` (user prompted), `plan` (review phase), `acceptEdits` (file operations only), `bypassPermissions` (skip all except safety), `dontAsk` (convert ask to deny), `auto` (YOLO classifier decides)
- **7-Stage Decision Pipeline**: deny rules → ask rules → tool checkPermissions() → bypass logic → entire-tool rules → passthrough conversion → classifier/fallback
- **YOLO Classifier**: Two-stage design with 64-token fast-pass (explicit denials) and 4,096-token reasoning for nuanced decisions
- **Denial Escalation**: 3 consecutive or 20 total denials trigger automatic fallback to manual approval mode
- **Dangerous Mode Stripping**: Auto mode automatically removes permission rules that would bypass the classifier to prevent circumvention
- **Feature-Gated Killswitch**: GrowthBook controls disable `bypassPermissions` and `auto` modes at runtime for safety rollback

### Bash Parser Security

- **Fail-Closed Design**: Hand-rolled recursive descent parser with allowlist-based AST node filtering
- **15 Dangerous Node Types**: Control flow structures, compound operations, patterns blocked in security-sensitive contexts
- **35+ Blocked Builtins**: Dangerous shell operations (eval, source, trap, enable, declare, typeset, etc.) rejected outright
- **Subscript Arithmetic Detection**: Array subscript operations with arithmetic expressions caught as RCE vectors
- **Path Constraint Checking**: Detects relative path escapes, newline injection, hash-based path manipulation
- **4,437 LOC Implementation**: 23 files across parser, AST walker, semantic checker, and permission matcher

### OAuth Security

- **Authorization Code Flow**: Standard OAuth 2.0 with PKCE for public clients
- **State Validation**: CSRF protection via state parameter verification
- **Token Caching**: 1-hour TTL with prompt caching for system context across classifier calls
- **Refresh Token Safety**: Secure token rotation and expiration handling

### Additional Security Controls

- **Windows ADS Detection**: Alternate Data Stream protection for Windows filesystem operations
- **Team Memory Isolation**: Credential separation between agents in swarm orchestration
- **Terminal Rendering Safety**: Output sanitization and keyboard input validation
- **De-sanitization Prevention**: Lookup tables for detecting vulnerable data transformation chains
