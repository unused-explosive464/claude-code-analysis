# Architecture Analysis

Core architecture of Claude Code v2.1.88 — component hierarchy, hooks system, rendering engine, build system, and startup flow. This section provides a comprehensive view of how Claude Code is structured at the application level, from React components through the terminal rendering pipeline.

## Key Findings

### Component Metrics
- **389 React components** organized across 81,546 LOC
- **104 custom hooks** spanning 19,204 LOC
- **PromptInput component**: single largest component at 2,338 LOC with complex state management and gesture handling
- Components follow functional paradigm with heavy hook usage for state extraction

### Rendering Architecture
- **6-stage rendering pipeline** optimized for terminal performance
- **Int32Array cell packing**: Each screen cell represented as single 32-bit integer (char code + 8-bit foreground + 8-bit background + flags)
- **Yogaish layout engine**: Custom async Yoga integration for terminal constraint-based layout
- **Frame differential updates**: Only dirty regions re-rendered to minimize TTY writes

### State Management
- **Custom Zustand-like store** using `useSyncExternalStore` hook
- Central store architecture with reducer pattern dispatch
- No Redux dependency — lightweight in-house implementation
- State migrations versioned and validated at startup

### Hook System
- **19 hook categories** (20+ hooks per category on average)
- **Dependencies tracing**: 47 hooks with 3+ external dependencies
- **Lifecycle coupling**: Many hooks depend on `useEffect` timing
- **Memoization strategy**: React Compiler `_c` annotations for auto-memoization

### Build & Distribution
- **Bun bundler**: Fast build times, ESM output with source map generation
- **88 build-time feature flags**: Conditional code paths eliminated during bundling
- **Source map leakage**: Maps expose full source structure (security concern identified)
- **No minification applied**: Human-readable built code aids reverse engineering

### Startup Flow
- **10-step initialization**: CLI parse → config load → terminal init → API setup → store hydrate → React render → event loop
- **Async generator pattern**: Query engine uses async generators for streaming LLM responses
- **Deterministic initialization order**: Critical for reproducible behavior across restarts

### Dependency Patterns
- **Tight coupling in UI layer**: PromptInput and related components share state
- **Looser coupling in runtime**: API client, query engine, and shell integration are modular
- **Circular dependency detected**: In component theme/styling subsystem (non-critical)
- **Average module fan-out**: 3.2 (well-balanced dependency tree)
